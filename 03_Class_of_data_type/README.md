```Java
import java.lang.*;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x;
		Integer y;
		// here integer is a class of int,it have store all data about int data type(primitive data type) 
		//e.g- what is the range of int data type,
		     //what is the byte int takes
		 System.out.println(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
		 System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
		 System.out.println(Integer.BYTES);
		 
		 // if we want to cheak, what is the minimum or maximum value of data types like, int,char,float,short,long,byte etc.
		 //we have to use upper statement, upper statment is defind for Integer class but we can use diffrent classs
		 // for diffrent data types
		 
		 // here is one more statement is add name as BYTES, it is use to print how to much bytes data types are storing
		 // for boolean there is no maximum and minimum value, for boolean true or false statement is been used.
		 // boolean have not fixed size, so byte keyword is not used in boolean.
