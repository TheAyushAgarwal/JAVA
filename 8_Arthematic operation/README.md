```Java
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    int a=14,b=5;
	    int c=a/b;
	    int r=a%b;
	    
	    System.out.println(c);
	    // here we are getting the value 2 because we are storing it into a interger type variable
	    System.out.println(r);
	    // here we are getting the value 4 because we are storing it into a interger type variable
	    
	    float d=(float)a/b;
	    // here we are getting the value 2.8 beacuse we typed cast it and store into a float varible
	    
	    System.out.println(d);
	    
	    //we can't store larger data type into a lower data type e.g long into int,double into float etc
	    
	}
}

```
