```Java
package com.company;
import java.lang.*;
//here import lang is showing that we are importing language package

class Main {
    // 1) class name should be same as file name, it can you different also.
    // 2) we have to write our main function between class.
    // 3) what ever class you are giving first letter of the class name must be capital.

    public static void main(String[] args)
     // here Public means, Every compiler read my code easily
     // here void means return type, it will not return anything, Java is not like C language it doesn't support int main type..
     // here main is function/method, starting part of our program
     //static is an object, we will study later on this.
     // String[] args, command and arguments, we will study later on this
     // here String[] have capital "S", because it is a class, class first letter must be capital
    {

        System.out.println("hello world");
        // here System is a class.
        // here system.out means, we are taking out something from the system/class
        // out is an object
        // println is a function/method which will work here as a printing.
    }
}
```
